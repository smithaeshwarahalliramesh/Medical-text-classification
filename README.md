# Medical-text-classification
Develop predictive models that can determine, given a medical abstract, which of 5 classes it falls in.

Medical abstracts describe the current conditions of a patient. Doctors routinely scan dozens or hundreds of abstracts each day 
as they do their rounds in a hospital and must quickly pick up on the salient information pointing to the patientâ€™s malady. The 
aim of this project is to design assistive technology that can identify, with high precision, the class of problems described 
in the abstract. In the given dataset, abstracts from 5 different conditions have been included: digestive system diseases, 
cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions.

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can determine, given a particular medical abstract, which one of 
5 classes it belongs to.

min-epsilon k-NN classifier:
  The min-epsilon k-NN classifier is defined similarly as the k-NN classifier with the exception that neighbors 2 to k are 
additionally restricted to have a minimum similarity of epsilon with the query object. In other words, neighbors are restricted 
by both number of neighbors and minimum similarity, but always at least one neighbor is retrieved.
